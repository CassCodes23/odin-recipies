			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				There’s nothing quite like the soft, flaky, buttery taste of homemade
				crescent rolls. No one can resist these when they’re hot, fresh, and
				filled with butter!

				</li>
				<li>

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Grease or butter a large bowl and set it aside.
				</li>
				<li>
					Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and spray the foil with nonstick spray.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the yeast, half-and-half, honey, melted butter, and sugar together. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.
					<ul>
						<li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
						<li>1.25 cups half and half</li>
						<li>2 tablespoons of honey</li>
						<li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
						<li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Switch to the dough hook and add the egg, 2 cups flour, and the salt. Beat on low speed and add the remaining 2 cups of flour in ½ cup increments. Beat until an elastic, smooth, and slightly tacky ball of dough forms, about 1 minute. Set the mixer to medium speed and continue mixing until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth and elastic, about 6 minutes.
					<ul>
						<li>1 large egg</li>
						<li>4-4.5 cups all purpose flour</li>
						<li>1.5 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
					</ul>
					
				</li>
				<li>
					Place the ball of dough in the prepared, buttered bowl, turning it to completely coat. Cover with a lightweight, clean dishtowel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gently punch the dough down and turn it onto a lightly floured work countertop. Divide the dough in half and roll the first half into a 12-inch circle. Use a pizza cutter to cut it into 12 equal wedges. Repeat with the remaining dough. Roll the wedges, starting at the wide end, and place them point side down and slightly curve the ends, 2 inches apart, onto the prepared baking sheets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cover with a clean dishtowel and set in a warm spot to double in size, about 30-45 minutes. (At this point, rolls can be refrigerated up to 24 hours, if desired.)
				</li>
				<li>
					If cooking immediately, preheat oven to 350°F, and bake 14-18 minutes or until lightly golden brown.
				</li>
				<li>
					Let cool for at least 10 minutes, then serve warm or at room temperature with honey butter, if desired.
