			<h2>Steps</h2>

				<strong> *READ THROUGH ALL INTRUCTIONS AND NOTES BEFORE STARTING* </strong>
			</h2>
			<h3>One to Two Days Ahead</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack inside or over the baking sheet.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Tie the tenderloin with butcher’s twine at 1-inch intervals.
					<ul>
						<li>3lbs beef tenderloin</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
				Generously season all sides with salt and peppercorns (or pepper)
				<ul>
					<li>Kosher Salt</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Set the beef on the wire rack and transfer to the refrigerator (uncovered) to chill for at least 8 hours and up to 48 hours.
				</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>When Ready to Cook</h3>
				<ol>
				
					<li>
					Set the oven rack to the middle position and preheat oven to 225°F.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Place the beef with the rack and baking sheet onto the kitchen counter 30 minutes before cooking.
				</li>
				
				<li>After 30 minutes, transfer the tenderloin/rack/baking sheet to the oven and cook 2-3 hours, or until a meat thermometer, placed in the center of the tenderloin, registers 120°-125°. Remove the beef from the oven for 10 minutes and cut off the twine.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>To Finish Under the Broiler</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>Place the oven rack 6 inches from the broiler element and set the oven to broil.</li>
				
				<li>
					Heat a cast iron skillet over medium heat and add the butter. Melt the butter, while gently swirling the pan, until foaming subsides and butter turns a light brown and has a nutty fragrance (be careful not to burn the butter).
					<ul>
						<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the thyme, garlic and shallots. Cook 30-60 seconds after the crackling stops. Pour the seasoned butter through a mesh strainer over a medium bowl.
					<ul>
						<li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
						<li>2 cloves garlic</li>
						<li>1 shallot</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Pour the butter mixture evenly over the tenderloin and brush with a silicone brush or baste with a spoon until all surfaces are coated.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Place the pan with the tenderloin under the broiler and broil, turning every 30 seconds, until meat is browned on all sides, baste each time the meat is turned.
				</li>
				
				<li>
					Transfer the tenderloin to a cutting board. Let is rest 5-10 minutes and slice into ½–inch slices.
				</li>

				<li>To serve, sprinkle with coarse sea salt and chives (if desired) and serve with Brandy Peppercorn Sauce, our personal favorite (see recipe) or Horseradish Sauce (see recipe).
					<ul>
					<li>Coarse sea salt</li>
					<li>Brandy Peppercorn Sauce</li>
					<li>Mustard Cream Sauce</li>
					<li>Chopped Fresh Chives</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
